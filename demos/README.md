## Running the Demos

Each demo is a complete .NET project that you can run independently:

```bash
cd Demo.TddRepl
dotnet restore Demo.TddRepl.sln
dotnet build Demo.TddRepl.sln --no-restore
dotnet test Demo.TddRepl.sln --no-build
```

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 or higher
- Azure OpenAI API access (configure in user secrets)
- For MCP demos: Additional service API keys as needed

## Configuration

Set up your API keys using user secrets:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "AzureOpenAI_ApiKey" "your-key" --project Demo.TddRepl
dotnet user-secrets set "AzureOpenAI_Endpoint" "https://your-endpoint.openai.azure.com/" --project Demo.TddRepl
dotnet user-secrets set "AzureOpenAI_Deployment" "your-deployment-name" --project Demo.TddRepl
```

Each demo provides practical, real-world examples of how to use skUnit effectively in different scenarios.
